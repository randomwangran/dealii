Let's say you've unpacked the .tar.gz file into a directory /path/to/dealii/sources. 
Then configure, compile, and install the deal.II library with:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/where/dealii/should/be/installed/to /path/to/dealii/sources
    $ make install    (alternatively $ make -j<N> install)
    $ make test

To build from the repository, execute the following commands first:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dealii/dealii
    $ cd dealii
